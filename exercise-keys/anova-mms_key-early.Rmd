## Study results

We counted the number of M&Ms in 49 packages of fun-size M&Ms for Halloween. There were a mean of 6.36 (sd = 1.03) in the caramel M&Ms packages, 7.19 (sd = .54) in the peanut M&Ms packages, and 15.68 (sd = 1.29) in the milk-chocolate M&Ms packages (Table 1; Figure 1)

```{r echo = FALSE}
# descriptive statistics
library(package = "tableone")
mm.table <- CreateTableOne(data = mm.data,
                           strata = "type.mm",
                           vars = c("number.mm"))
print(mm.table)

# boxplot of m&ms by type
library(package = "tidyverse")
mm.data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = type.mm, y = number.mm, fill = type.mm)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2", guide = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "M & M type", y = "Number of pieces per package",
       subtitle = "Figure 1. M & Ms per package for 49 packages of fun-sized M & Ms (2019)") +
  theme_bw()
```

A one-way ANOVA comparing the mean number of M&Ms in fun-size packages for Halloween was statistically significant (F(2,46) = 438.96; p < .05) indicating that the mean number of candies per package is different across M&M types. Bonferroni post-hoc tests found that the mean number of M&Ms in milk-chocolate type package was statistically significantly (p < .05) different from the mean number in the peanut and caramel types (see Table 1 for means). A planned comparison grouping caramel and peanut types (m = 6.85; sd = .86) and comparing this grouped mean to the mean number in milk-chocolate also found a statistically significant (p < .05) difference in means. The data did not meet the normality assumption but did meet the equal variances assumption, so these results should not be generalized outside the sample. It appears that, to get the most candy trick-or-treating, kids should choose plain M&Ms when given a choice, but to be sure, a different analysis strategy might be useful.
